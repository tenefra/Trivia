# Tandem Trivia
> A hub to test your trivia skills against your coworkers at Tandem.

## Why

This project was created as part of the 2021 Tandem Apprenticeship coding challenge - but it's true purpose is to test our trivia knowledge, and most importantly, to have fun!

## Usage

This quiz is a super compact, easy to use app that will bring you back to the days of NES gaming! Development of this quiz I had one thing in mind, why do people play triva? The answer is that it's fun - it's a friendly environment to be competitive.

Developed simply with Vanilla JavaScript, the player will be pitched a random assortment of 10 trivia questions, and will have 10 seconds to answer reach question. At the end of each round, the score will be tallied and the player will be greated with a snarky, or complimenting comment depending on their score.

Want to play another round? Press the replay button and you'll start a brand new round with a brand new score!

## Additions for the future

In the future I would like to add a 2 player mode that allows coworkers to face off while taking a break from work, instead of on their respective computers, just to add to the feeling of friendly competition you get from trivia.

I also have plans to recreate this app in React. Currently I'm polishing my Vanilla JS skills and plan to transfer into React development within the next month. In that case functionality will be improved and 2 player mode will be available.
