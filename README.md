## Usage

This quiz is a super compact, easy to use app that will bring you back to the days of NES gaming! Development of this quiz I had one thing in mind, why do people play triva? The answer is that it's fun - it's a friendly environment to be competitive.

Developed simply with Vanilla JavaScript, the player will be pitched a random assortment of 10 trivia questions, and will have 10 seconds to answer reach question. At the end of each round, the score will be tallied and the player will be greated with a snarky, or complimenting comment depending on their score.
